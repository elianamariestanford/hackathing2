***TIMELENS X GCAL***

**Short description of what you attempted to build**
I built a web application that connects to a user’s primary Google Calendar and analyzes how their time is distributed across different categories. Calendar events are automatically classified as Academic, Social, or Other using keyword-based heuristics, and the application summarizes how much time the user spends in each category over upcoming weeks. The goal was to create an early prototype of a “time awareness” tool that makes invisible time commitments more legible.

**What you learned**
Through this project, I learned how to integrate Google OAuth authentication and the Google Calendar API into a full-stack web application. I gained hands-on experience managing authentication tokens, handling API permissions, and debugging client–server data flows in a modern Next.js environment. The project also pushed me to apply and strengthen my web development skills, particularly around API routing, state management, and data aggregation.

**How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?**
This Hack-a-Thing serves as a preliminary step toward the broader TimeLens concept, particularly as an early integration with Google Calendar. It helped me explore how external APIs can be used to extract meaningful behavioral data and how that data can be transformed into interpretable insights. The experience of working with real-world calendar data and building categorization logic directly informs how I might expand TimeLens into a more robust time-tracking and reflection tool.

**What didn’t work**
Debugging the many moving parts of the system was the most challenging aspect of the project. Coordinating authentication, API permissions, server-side logic, and client-side rendering required careful troubleshooting, especially when errors occurred across multiple layers of the stack. There are many areas that could be further refined or expanded, including more sophisticated categorization logic, improved UI design, and broader customization options for users.

**AI Citation**: I used ChatGPT as a development aid throughout this project, particularly for high-level structural guidance such as organizing API routes, integrating the Google Calendar API, implementing layout components, reasoning through categorization logic, syntax support, architectural suggestions, and troubleshooting during development.
